## Prerequisites
So you want to be a hacker? Here's everything, for now...
- Computer (desktop/laptop)
- Internet connection
- Search Engine ([Google](https://google.com), [Duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com), [Brave](https://search.brave.com))
- G Fuel, assorted flavors of Doritos and a [Guy Fawkes mask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Fawkes_mask)

## Mindset
> "There is no universal set of agreed-upon rules that hackers follow..." 
> 
> -- Dennis Devey, [HowToHack](https://www.hoppersroppers.org/howtohack/)
- Problem-solving is now a hobby, and it's hard.
- Problems shouldn't be solved twice, take notes.
- Find fun problems to solve, and stay curious.
- Share solutions to problems, and start a blog.

## Set-Up
Before hacking The Pentagon, let's get prepared.

1. Set up a Virtual Machine (VM) software using [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
2. Set up a Linux VM using [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/), see [docs](https://www.kali.org/docs/installation/hard-disk-install/).
3. In your Kali Linux VM, open the terminal and run `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`.
