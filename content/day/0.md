## Prerequisites
So you want to be a hacker? Here's everything you need, for now...
- A computer desktop or laptop with an internet connection.
- A search engine like [Google](https://google.com), [Duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com), or [Brave](https://search.brave.com).
- G Fuel, assorted flavors of Doritos, and a [Guy Fawkes mask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Fawkes_mask).

## Mindset
> "There is no universal set of agreed-upon rules that hackers follow..." 
> 
> -- Dennis Devey, [HowToHack](https://www.hoppersroppers.org/howtohack/)
- Problem-solving is now a hobby, and it's hard.
- Problems shouldn't be solved twice, take notes.
- Find fun problems to solve, and stay curious.
- Share solutions to problems, and start a blog.

## Set-Up
Before hacking The Pentagon, let's get prepared.

1. Set up a Virtual Machine (VM) hypervisor like [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) or [VMWare](https://www.vmware.com/).
2. Set up a [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/) VM, and use the [docs](https://www.kali.org/docs/installation/hard-disk-install/) for help.
3. In your Kali Linux VM, open the terminal and run `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`.
